The completion of this dissertation is the culmination of a journey that would not have been possible without the support, guidance, and collaboration of several people and institutions, to whom I wish to express my deepest gratitude.

To my supervisors, Professor José Machado, PhD, and Professor Regina Sousa, PhD, I thank you for the scientific guidance, methodological rigor, and constant encouragement. Professor José Machado's vast experience in health information systems and Professor Regina Sousa's insightful technical contributions on software architecture were fundamental pillars for the realization of this project.

I express my gratitude to Professor António Abelha, PhD, whose guidance in the clinical context and mastery of data analysis were crucial for understanding the complex processes of hospital medication management.

To the University of Minho and its School of Engineering, I am grateful for the conditions and resources provided, which were essential for the development of this research.

My gratitude extends to the administration and healthcare professionals of the Hospital da Misericórdia de Vila Verde (SCMVV). Their availability and the sharing of practical knowledge on hospital management and the systems in production were invaluable. Special thanks are due to the SCMVV's information systems technicians for their assistance and for providing the access that allowed a detailed analysis of the legacy systems.

To my colleagues from the Master's in Bioinformatics Engineering, I thank you for the camaraderie, the enriching discussions, and the knowledge sharing that so greatly contributed to my academic growth.

Finally, to my family, a heartfelt thank you for the unconditional support, patience, and constant encouragement, which were my safe harbor throughout this journey.

To everyone, my sincerest thanks.
