\section{Context and Problem Definition}

Medication management is a high-stakes, complex process central to modern healthcare delivery. Its successful execution is critical for patient safety, yet it remains a major source of preventable adverse events. The landmark report "To Err is Human" by the Institute of Medicine brought global attention to the prevalence of medical errors, identifying them as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality \cite{kohn2000}. Subsequent research and initiatives by the World Health Organization have reinforced this reality, indicating that medication-related harm affects one in ten patients globally and that the associated costs are substantial \cite{who2017, who2022}.

A primary contributing factor to this problem is the fragmented nature of Health Information Technology (HIT) ecosystems within hospitals \cite{berwick2008}. Many healthcare institutions operate on a patchwork of legacy systems, often developed decades apart using disparate technologies \cite{kazemi2016}. This technological heterogeneity creates significant barriers to interoperability, resulting in information silos where critical patient data is not shared effectively between departments or professionals \cite{keasberry2017}. The workflow, which should be a seamless continuum from a physician's prescription to pharmaceutical validation and finally to nursing administration, is often interrupted by manual processes, verbal communications, and data re-entry, each step introducing a new opportunity for error.

The Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia de Vila Verde (SCMVV) serves as a representative case study for these systemic challenges. Its core operations rely on the AIDA-PCE, a legacy system with significant limitations, including a non-intuitive interface, a lack of real-time clinical decision support (e.g., for drug interactions), and poor integration capabilities \cite{moss2015, bowles2020}. This environment compromises patient safety and hampers operational efficiency. This dissertation addresses these issues by detailing the design, development, and implementation of a modern, integrated medication management system aimed at creating a cohesive, safe, and efficient clinical workflow.

\section{Objectives}

The primary goal of this research is to develop and evaluate an integrated medication management system that optimizes the prescription, validation, dispensing, and administration processes at the SCMVV, thereby enhancing patient safety and operational efficiency.

To achieve this overarching goal, the following specific scientific and technological objectives were defined:

\subsection{Scientific Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To analyze the impact of the integrated system on the rate of medication errors, quantifying the reduction in prescribing and administration faults.
    \item To evaluate the system's effect on clinical workflow efficiency by measuring key performance indicators, such as the time required for prescription and dispensing.
    \item To assess the usability and acceptance of the new system among clinical staff (physicians, pharmacists, and nurses) using established frameworks.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Technological Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To design and implement a scalable and resilient backend based on a microservices architecture using Node.js and Java.
    \item To develop a robust, real-time clinical decision support engine for validating prescriptions against potential drug-drug interactions, allergies, and dosage errors \cite{belle2013}.
    \item To create a responsive and intuitive user interface using modern web technologies, such as React and Next.js, to streamline clinical tasks \cite{misra2023}.
    \item To ensure seamless, bidirectional integration with existing legacy systems, including the hospital's primary information system and pharmacy software, through a secure RESTful API layer \cite{mandl2020}.
    \item To establish a comprehensive audit trail for all medication-related activities, ensuring full traceability from prescription to administration \cite{european2016}.
\end{enumerate}
