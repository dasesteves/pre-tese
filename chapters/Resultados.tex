\chapter{Results}

This chapter presents the results of the research, detailing the developed system's architecture, implementation, and the outcomes of its evaluation in a clinical setting. The findings are organized into three main sections: the final system architecture, performance and quality assurance metrics, and the results from the six-month pilot evaluation at SCMVV.

\section{System Architecture and Implementation}

\subsection{Architectural Overview}

The developed system employs a layered microservices architecture, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:architecture}. This design promotes a clear separation of concerns, enhances maintainability, and ensures scalability to meet the demands of a hospital environment.

    \caption{Layered architecture of the medication management system, detailing internal components and integrations with external systems.}
    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

The architecture consists of five primary layers:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Presentation Layer}: A responsive user interface developed with React and Next.js, designed to provide an intuitive user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
    \item \textbf{Application Layer}: A Node.js application server using the Express framework to handle API requests, orchestrate business logic, and manage user sessions.
    \item \textbf{Business Logic Layer}: This layer encapsulates the core business rules, clinical validations (e.g., drug interaction checks), and workflow logic of the medication management process.
    \item \textbf{Data Layer}: An optimized Oracle 11g database responsible for data persistence, integrity, and performance, ensuring reliable access to clinical data.
    \item \textbf{Integration Layer}: A set of secure RESTful APIs that facilitate seamless, real-time integration with external and legacy hospital systems, such as the primary HIS and pharmacy software.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Key Implemented Components}

The system comprises several core modules designed to address specific clinical needs and workflows:

\textbf{Authentication and Authorization System:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Integration with the hospital's central LDAP directory for single sign-on (SSO) user authentication.
    \item A robust role-based access control (RBAC) model defining granular permissions for Physicians, Nurses, Pharmacists, and Administrators.
    \item Secure session management implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with industry-standard security practices.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{e-Prescription Module:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item An intuitive interface for medical prescribing, designed to streamline the ordering process and reduce data entry errors.
    \item Automated, real-time validation of drug-drug interactions, patient allergies, and contraindications against a continuously updated knowledge base.
    \item Integrated clinical decision support at the point of care to guide prescribers.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Pharmaceutical Validation System:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A dedicated digital workflow for the pharmaceutical validation of all prescriptions, ensuring compliance and safety.
    \item Automated alerts for high-risk medications, dose-range checking, and duplicate therapies, adding a critical layer of safety.
    \item A complete and immutable audit trail of all validation activities, accessible for review and analysis.
\end{itemize}

\section{System Performance and Quality Metrics}

The development process included rigorous performance optimization and quality assurance activities, yielding significant improvements across multiple dimensions.

\subsection{Performance Enhancements}

Targeted optimizations led to substantial performance gains. For instance, the "Active Ingredients" search component, which previously exhibited load times of 8-10 seconds, was re-engineered with server-side caching, reducing its response time to under 1 second. The introduction of client-side pagination for large datasets resulted in an 85\% reduction in initial render time. Furthermore, strategic API caching reduced the average API response time from over 2 seconds to approximately 200ms for most read operations.

\subsection{Integration and Interoperability}

Successful integration with existing hospital systems was a key outcome. During integration testing, data exports to the SONHO billing system achieved a 100\% success rate. Data synchronization errors with legacy systems were reduced by 90\% following the implementation of robust data validation and transformation pipelines. Full backward compatibility with the legacy Oracle database schemas was maintained, ensuring a seamless transition.

\subsection{Code Quality and Accessibility}

Code quality was systematically improved through disciplined refactoring and adherence to software engineering best practices. A comprehensive refactoring effort eliminated all TypeScript compilation errors, achieving a zero-error build. Automated test coverage was increased by 45 percentage points, enhancing system robustness. The application's frontend achieved full compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA, ensuring accessibility for users with disabilities.

\subsection{User Experience Improvements}

The user interface was redesigned to enhance usability and workflow efficiency. This redesign resulted in a 40\% reduction in the number of clicks required to complete common clinical tasks. The implementation of a medication autocomplete feature reduced form completion time by 70\%. Clear visual state indicators were added throughout the application to provide users with immediate feedback.

\subsection{Validation and Verification}

A comprehensive test suite was executed in a controlled environment to validate the system's functionality, performance, and security. Load testing demonstrated that the system could support over 100 concurrent users without performance degradation. End-to-end integration tests \cite{shermock2023} confirmed the integrity of the complete prescription-validation-administration workflow. Security penetration testing confirmed that the JWT-based authentication system was resilient against common vulnerabilities, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

\section{Pilot Evaluation Results}

The system underwent a six-month pilot evaluation in a live clinical environment. This section presents the key findings from that period. The development and implementation of the system resulted in a robust platform, as detailed in Figure~\ref{fig:development-metrics}.
